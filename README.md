# Sunny Day for micro

This is a theme for the [micro editor](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/), 
based off of the [excellent theme](https://github.com/mswift42/sunny-day-theme)
of the same name by Martin Haesler. The colors are not 1-to-1 because of the limitations
of 256-color terminals and micro's syntax highlighting engine, but it is very close.
